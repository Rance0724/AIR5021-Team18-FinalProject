This project aims to realize a robot-arm ball-catching program. However, when conducting experiments, we find the moving speed of the robot arm is too low. Hence, we transfer our research focus on the ball trajectory prediction.
There are two python files. One use the Kalman Filter in the prediction preocess, the other not. You can run the corresponding .launch file to see the difference of prediction quality.
